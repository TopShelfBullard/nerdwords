Nerdwords

---  
Nerdwords is a fun attempt for me to learn rails and a chance to redeem myself from my final project for programming fundamentals a couple years ago (if you want a good laugh, here's my blog post from way back then about the final project incident: <a href="http://bullardamitchell.wordpress.com/2013/05/13/h1a-quest-to-discover-things-ive-already-been-given-h1/">A quest to Discover Things I've Already Been Given</a>). This app requires styling, which it will get shortly, and there are a couple defects that have to be addressed. Eventually, I hope that Nerdwords will do a bit more, but for now it just takes in a group of letters from the user and outputs any English word that any combination of those letters can make.  

And please don't blame the developer if you loose to your friends at Scrabble because they are running Nerdwords. I assume no responsibility for user dishonesty.
